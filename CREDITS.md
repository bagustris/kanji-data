`kanji_metadata.json` additionally carries WaniKani-style level/meaning/
reading/radical fields (`wk_*`) layered on top of the KANJIDIC2 facts.
"WaniKani" is a product of [Tofugu / WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/);

## KRADFILE (`radicals/kradfile`)

Kanji-to-radical decomposition table, originally compiled by Jim Rose at
Kanji Cafe (`KRADFILE2`), now maintained by EDRDG.

## Tanaka Corpus (`sentences/examples.utf`)

Indexed example sentences, originally from the Tanaka Corpus
(<https://tatoeba.org/>), distributed by EDRDG as part of
`JMdict_e_examp.xml`. Used here in its original per-word-indexed form to
back the `sentence`/`kana`/`translation` columns in `kanji/kanji_n{1-5}.csv`.

## Kanjium pitch-accent database (`compounds/accents_kanjium.txt`)

Word/reading → pitch-accent-kernel-position data, from the
[Kanjium](https://github.com/mifunetoshiro/kanjium) project by
mifunetoshiro. Used by `scripts/add_pitch_accent.py` to annotate compound
readings in `kanji/kanji_n{1-5}.csv` with their pitch accent. Kanjium does
not publish a formal licence file; it's widely reused by other
Japanese-study tooling (e.g. Yomichan/Yomitan) on an attribution basis —
verify current terms at the source repo before any redistribution beyond
this project's own apps.

## JMdict / KANJIDIC via kanjiapi.dev (`kanji/kyoiku-grade{1-9}.json`, `words/kyoiku-words{1-9}.json`)

- Fetched via the free [kanjiapi.dev](https://kanjiapi.dev/) service, which
  redistributes JMdict/KANJIDIC under the same licence — see
  `scripts/kyoiku/audit-readings.js`, `audit-words.js`,
  `fetch-example-words.js`.

## Kanji alive (some example words, `kanji/kyoiku-grade{1-9}.json`)

Where JMdict-based curation hadn't reached a kanji yet, its `examples` were
backfilled from the [Kanji alive](https://kanjialive.com) project's
language-data CSV via `scripts/kyoiku/fetch-examples-kanjialive.js`.

## Original content (`sentences/kyoiku-sentences{1-9}.json`)

Example sentences are original content written for this project, not
excerpts from any commercial textbook or dictionary corpus — each sentence
was written from scratch specifically to demonstrate its target kanji/word.

## KanjiVG (`stroke-order/kanjivg/`)

Stroke-order SVG diagrams, mirrored here from the
[jed](https://github.com/bagustris/jed) app's own data (jōyō kanji only,
2,136 characters — not KanjiVG's full ~11,000-character set).

## Tanaka Corpus + furigana (`sentences/jed-kanji-sentences.json`)

Per-kanji example sentences, mirrored here from jed's own data. Sourced
from EDRDG's `JMdict_e_examp.xml` (Tanaka Corpus, same family as
`sentences/examples.utf` above), with furigana readings added by jed's
`tools/build_furigana.py` from EDRDG's `examples.utf`.

## What is NOT from any workbook

Kanji readings, meanings, and JLPT-level/grade assignments are language
facts taken from the dictionaries above (or MEXT's 学年別漢字配当表 for grade
assignments), not transcribed from any commercial workbook or app.

## License note

Any redistribution of this repo's `kanji/`, `radicals/`, `words/`,
`compounds/`, `sentences/`, or `stroke-order/` directories should carry
this file along with it.
